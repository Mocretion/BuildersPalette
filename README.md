## What it does
This **client side** mod **shuffles** your **hotbar** items based on from you defined and selected "block palettes".

## What it is for
Its purpose is to add texture to your builds as you build them without the hassle to scroll manually through your hotbar or shift items from your inventory to your hotbar all the time.

## How to use
First, open the GUI ("B" by default) and create a palette.

Each palette contains blocks added by yourself, with a weight assigned to them.
The weight specifies how often a block should occur in your texturing.
After defining a plaette, select a hotbar slot it should work on and select the palette itself.
Close the menu, select the hotbar slot and start building.

### Survival vs Creative
In survival, the palette's blocks are needed in your inventory, in creative the blocks are automatically taken from the creative inventory.
